# JSON Web Token (JWT) Tool

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive toolset for encoding, decoding, and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). It supports various cryptographic algorithms including HMAC, RSA, and ECDSA, allowing secure token operations essential for authentication and data exchange in web applications.

## Features

- **Encode JWT**: Easily encode JSON payloads into JWTs using specified signing algorithms (HS256, RS256, ES256).
- **Decode JWT**: Decode JWTs to inspect their header, payload, and signature components.
- **Verify JWT**: Verify the authenticity and integrity of JWTs using HMAC, RSA, or ECDSA algorithms.
- **Share Functionality**: Share JWT tool output or results via integrated sharing options.
